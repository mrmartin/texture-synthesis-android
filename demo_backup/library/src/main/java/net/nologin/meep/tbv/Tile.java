/**
 * The surface of a {@link TiledBitmapView} is rendered using a collection of these Tile objects, each holding a bitmap
 * suitable for rendering a square area of the surface.  The view calculates which tiles are required, and fetches them
 * from the {@link TileProvider}.  Each tile is then rendered at the correct location on the surface.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Tiles are IDed by their coordinates in a 2D plane. The co-ordinate convention is similar to that of the android canvas.
 * Negative, zero and positive values are permitted, the x values increase rightward, and the y values increase downward.
 * Eg, tile <code>(0,1)</code> is located directly below <code>(0,0)</code>, and to the left of <code>(1,1)</code>.
 * <br/><br/>
 * All tiles contain a mutable bitmap, allowing {@link TileProvider} implementations to generate the renderable
 * content when ready, and also to clear that content should the tile go off-screen (to save heap memory) without
 * the allocation overhead of creating both Tile and Bitmap objects.
